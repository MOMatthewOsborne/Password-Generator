# Password-Generator
A website that generates a random password for the user.

This website asks the user the desired length of their password and which character types they want included. It will then generate a password within those parameters.  

# Challenges

This challenge had a number of topics that I had not covered before, mostly related to Document Object Model.  Working with functions for the first time was also a challenge. 

# What I learned

This was my first experience of javascript interacting with the HTML. In this application the generated password is diplayed on the actual website. Normally I have been used to working with console logs and alerts. 

Also, it is my first experience of event listeners and Document Object Model related tasks. I have learned that there is a lot that I need to learn about these topics.

Here is a screenshot of the application.
